# Discord bot that connects to the Eleven Labs API and generates TTS.

## Features:
*   Joins VC and plays TTS (_/vcmeow voice prompt similarity clarity_)
*   Queue system for TTS
*   Generates and sends TTS through chat (_/meow voice prompt similarity clarity_)
*   Autocompletes the voice parameter with whatever voices you have
*   (meow)

## Features I would like to add:
*   Connection to OpenAI's API to create a new /_(vc)mimic_ command
     * Would take the user's prompt and run it through OpenAI's ChatGPT API to then have the response read out.
